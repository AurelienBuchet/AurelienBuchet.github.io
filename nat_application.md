This application generates random identifiers and periodically sends them to a reporting server.
The server stores the identifiers and the IP addresses used to send them in order to study if IP tracking mechanism can uniquely identify a given user.
All information you provide will be treated anonymously and confidentially. Neither your name nor your contact details will be collected, stored nor made public.
We will also keep confidential all the IP addresses and the identifiers gathered during the measurements. Only dummy values will be used to illustrate approaches, theories or model.
If you have any question regarding the application or the data collected, feel free to contact us at aurelien.buchet@uclouvain.be.
